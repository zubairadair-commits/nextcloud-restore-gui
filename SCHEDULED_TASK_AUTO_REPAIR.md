# Scheduled Task Auto-Repair Feature

## Overview
The Nextcloud Restore & Backup Utility now automatically detects when the application has been moved to a new location and repairs the Windows scheduled task to use the new path. This ensures scheduled backups continue working even after moving, renaming, or reorganizing the application directory.

## Features

### Automatic Detection on Startup
- **Zero Configuration**: No user intervention required
- **Silent Operation**: Only notifies user if repair is performed
- **Non-Intrusive**: Runs in background 1 second after app starts
- **Safe**: Handles errors gracefully without disrupting startup

### Intelligent Path Comparison
- **Normalizes Paths**: Handles case differences and path separators
- **Detects Moves**: Compares current executable path with scheduled task path
- **Supports Both Types**: Works with both Python scripts (.py) and compiled executables (.exe)

### Automatic Repair
- **Preserves Settings**: Maintains all existing task parameters
  - Backup directory
  - Encryption settings
  - Password (if configured)
  - Schedule type and time
- **Updates Path**: Recreates task with new application location
- **Notifies User**: Shows friendly dialog on successful repair

## How It Works

### Detection Flow
```
1. App starts up
   ↓
2. Wait 1 second (allow UI to initialize)
   ↓
3. Get current executable path
   ↓
4. Query Windows Task Scheduler for "NextcloudBackup" task
   ↓
5. Extract path from scheduled task command
   ↓
6. Normalize and compare paths
   ↓
7. If different → Repair needed
   ↓
8. Extract task parameters (backup dir, encryption, etc.)
   ↓
9. Recreate task with new path
   ↓
10. Show success notification to user
```

### Scenarios Handled

#### Scenario 1: App Moved to New Location
```
Before Move:
  App Location:    C:\Users\John\Downloads\nextcloud_backup.py
  Scheduled Task:  python "C:\Users\John\Downloads\nextcloud_backup.py" --scheduled ...

After Move:
  App Location:    D:\Applications\Backup\nextcloud_backup.py
  Scheduled Task:  python "C:\Users\John\Downloads\nextcloud_backup.py" --scheduled ... (OLD PATH)

Auto-Repair:
  Detection:       Paths differ → Repair needed
  Action:          Recreate task with new path
  Result:          python "D:\Applications\Backup\nextcloud_backup.py" --scheduled ... (NEW PATH)
  Notification:    "✅ Scheduled Task Auto-Repaired"
```

#### Scenario 2: App Not Moved
```
Current:
  App Location:    C:\Backup\app.exe
  Scheduled Task:  "C:\Backup\app.exe" --scheduled ...

Detection:
  Paths match → No repair needed
  Continue normal startup (no notification)
```

#### Scenario 3: No Scheduled Task Exists
```
Current:
  App Location:    C:\Backup\app.py
  Scheduled Task:  None (not configured)

Detection:
  No task to repair → Skip
  Continue normal startup (no notification)
```

## Technical Implementation

### New Functions

#### `get_scheduled_task_command(task_name)`
Queries Windows Task Scheduler to get the command/action configured for a task.

**Parameters:**
- `task_name` (str): Name of the scheduled task (e.g., "NextcloudBackup")

**Returns:** 
- Command string from the task, or None if not found

**Example:**
```python
command = get_scheduled_task_command("NextcloudBackup")
# Returns: 'python "C:\\path\\to\\script.py" --scheduled --backup-dir "C:\\backups"'
```

#### `extract_path_from_task_command(command)`
Extracts the executable/script path from a scheduled task command string.

**Handles Multiple Formats:**
- Python script: `python "C:\path\to\script.py" --args`
- Python script (alt): `python.exe "C:\path\to\script.py" --args`
- Executable: `"C:\path\to\app.exe" --args`

**Parameters:**
- `command` (str): Full command string from scheduled task

**Returns:** 
- Extracted path string, or None if unable to parse

**Example:**
```python
path = extract_path_from_task_command('python "C:\\app.py" --scheduled')
# Returns: 'C:\\app.py'
```

#### `check_and_repair_scheduled_task(task_name="NextcloudBackup")`
Main function that checks if app has moved and repairs the scheduled task.

**Process:**
1. Get current executable path
2. Query scheduled task command
3. Extract path from task command
4. Normalize and compare paths
5. If different, recreate task with new path

**Parameters:**
- `task_name` (str): Name of the scheduled task (default: "NextcloudBackup")

**Returns:** 
- `(repaired, message)` tuple
  - `repaired` (bool): True if task was repaired, False otherwise
  - `message` (str): Descriptive message about what happened

**Example:**
```python
repaired, message = check_and_repair_scheduled_task()
if repaired:
    print(f"Task repaired: {message}")
```

### Integration Points

#### Startup Check (`__init__` method)
```python
# Check and repair scheduled task if app has been moved
self.after(1000, self._check_scheduled_task_on_startup)
```
- Uses `after()` to delay check by 1 second
- Allows UI to initialize before checking
- Non-blocking - doesn't delay app startup

#### Notification Method (`_check_scheduled_task_on_startup`)
```python
def _check_scheduled_task_on_startup(self):
    """
    Check on startup if the scheduled task needs repair (app has been moved).
    Shows a notification to the user if repair was performed.
    """
    repaired, message = check_and_repair_scheduled_task("NextcloudBackup")
    
    if repaired:
        # Show success dialog to user
        # ... notification UI code ...
```

## User Experience

### Notification Dialog
When repair is performed, users see a friendly notification:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✅  Scheduled Task Auto-Repaired           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                             │
│  The application location has changed.      │
│  Scheduled backup task updated              │
│  automatically.                             │
│                                             │
│              [ OK ]                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Dialog Features:**
- ✅ Success icon and clear title
- 📝 Simple, non-technical message
- 🎨 Matches current app theme (light/dark)
- 🖱️ Single OK button to dismiss
- 📍 Centered on screen

## Edge Cases Handled

### Case-Insensitive Comparison
```python
# Handles Windows case-insensitivity
current_path_norm = os.path.normcase(os.path.normpath(current_path))
task_path_norm = os.path.normcase(os.path.normpath(task_path))
```

### Path Separators
```python
# Normalizes forward/backslashes
os.path.normpath(path)  # Converts to system-native separators
```

### Quoted Paths with Spaces
```python
# Regex handles quoted paths
match = re.search(r'python(?:\.exe)?\s+"([^"]+)"', command, re.IGNORECASE)
```

### Missing Parameters
```python
if not backup_dir:
    logger.error("Unable to extract backup directory from existing task")
    return False, "Unable to extract task parameters for repair"
```

### Error Handling
```python
try:
    # ... repair logic ...
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error checking/repairing scheduled task: {e}")
    return False, f"Error during repair: {str(e)}"
```

logger.error(f"Error checking scheduled task on startup: {e}")
logger.warning(f"Unable to extract path from task command: {task_command}")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Repair Doesn't Trigger
- **Check**: Is there a scheduled task named "NextcloudBackup"?
- **Check**: Is the app running on Windows?
- **Check**: Does the task command contain the old path?
- **Solution**: Create a new scheduled task if needed

### Repair Fails
- **Check**: Do you have permission to modify scheduled tasks?
- **Check**: Is the backup directory still accessible?
- **Solution**: Run app as administrator or check logs

### Notification Doesn't Appear
- **Check**: Did the path actually change?
- **Check**: Was notification dismissed quickly?
- **Solution**: Check log file for confirmation

### Path Extraction Fails
- **Check**: Is the task command in expected format?
- **Check**: Are paths properly quoted?
- **Solution**: Manually delete and recreate scheduled task
