✓ Each backup addition is logged with full metadata for debugging

1. Run a scheduled backup:
   python nextcloud_restore_and_backup-v9.py --scheduled --backup-dir "C:\\Backups" --encrypt --password "mypass"
   
2. Check the console output - you'll see:
   "✓ Backup added to history with ID: X"
   "  Database location: /home/user/.nextcloud_backup_utility/backup_history.db"
   
3. Check the log file at Documents/NextcloudLogs/nextcloud_restore_gui.log
   Look for lines with "BACKUP HISTORY:" and "SCHEDULED BACKUP:"
   
4. Open the GUI and click "Backup History" button
   You'll see the scheduled backup listed along with manual backups
