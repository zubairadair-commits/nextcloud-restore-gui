# Progress Bar Visual Update Fix

## Issue
The progress bar during extraction was not visually filling, even though the percentage value and current file were being updated correctly. Users could see the text updating (e.g., "Extracting: 150/1000 files") but the progress bar itself remained static at 0%.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `set_restore_progress()` method at line 6789 of `src/nextcloud_restore_and_backup-v9.py`.

The code was using:
```python
lambda: setattr(self.progressbar, 'value', percent)
```

This approach sets a Python attribute on the progressbar object but does **not** trigger tkinter's internal widget update mechanism. The tkinter ttk.Progressbar widget requires its properties to be set using the dictionary-style syntax or the `configure()` method to properly update the visual display.

## Solution
Changed line 6789 from:
```python
lambda: setattr(self.progressbar, 'value', percent)
```

To:
```python
lambda: self.progressbar.__setitem__('value', percent)
```

This is equivalent to writing:
```python
self.progressbar['value'] = percent
```

## Why This Works
The `__setitem__` method (used by dictionary-style access `widget['property'] = value`) properly:
1. Updates the internal widget state
2. Triggers tkinter's update mechanism
3. Causes the visual display to refresh
4. Ensures the progress bar fills progressively

## Technical Details

### tkinter ttk.Progressbar Update Methods
There are three main ways to update a ttk.Progressbar:

1. **Dictionary syntax** (CORRECT):
   ```python
   progressbar['value'] = 50
   ```
   
2. **Configure method** (CORRECT):
   ```python
   progressbar.configure(value=50)
   ```
   
3. **setattr** (INCORRECT for widgets):
   ```python
   setattr(progressbar, 'value', 50)  # Sets attribute but doesn't update widget!
   ```

The third approach (setattr) only modifies the Python object's attributes but doesn't interact with tkinter's C-level widget code that handles the visual rendering.

### Why the Fix is Minimal
The fix changes only **one line** of code, maintaining:
- The same `safe_widget_update()` wrapper for thread safety
- The same parameter names and function signature
- The same error handling logic
- The same overall program flow

## Impact
After this fix:
- ✅ Progress bar visually fills from 0% to 100% during extraction
- ✅ Progress updates are synchronized with percentage text
- ✅ Users can see real-time progress as files are extracted
- ✅ No change to the callback mechanism or extraction logic
- ✅ Thread-safe updates still work correctly
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass

## Testing
Created comprehensive test in `tests/test_progressbar_fix.py` that verifies:
1. The broken setattr pattern is removed
2. The correct __setitem__ pattern is in place
3. The set_restore_progress method exists
4. safe_widget_update is properly used
5. The code snippet is correct

All tests pass (5/5).

- tkinter documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#progressbar
- ttk.Progressbar properties must be set via dictionary access or configure()
- Line 5357 in the same file already uses the correct pattern: `self.progressbar['value'] = step`

## Security Analysis
- No security vulnerabilities introduced
- CodeQL analysis: 0 alerts
- No changes to data handling or external interfaces
- Only affects internal widget update mechanism
