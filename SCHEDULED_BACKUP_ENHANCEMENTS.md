# Scheduled Backup Enhancements

## Overview
This document describes the enhancements made to the scheduled backup functionality in the Nextcloud Restore & Backup Utility.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Run with Highest Privileges
**Change:** Added `/RL HIGHEST` flag to Windows Task Scheduler task creation.

**Location:** `create_scheduled_task()` function in `nextcloud_restore_and_backup-v9.py`

**Impact:** 
- Scheduled backup tasks now run with the highest available privileges
- Ensures backup can access all necessary files and Docker containers
- Prevents permission-related backup failures

**Technical Details:**
```python
schtasks_cmd = [
    "schtasks", "/Create",
    "/TN", task_name,
    "/TR", command,
    "/ST", schedule_time,
    "/RL", "HIGHEST",  # Run with highest privileges
    "/Z"  # Run task as soon as possible after scheduled start is missed
]
```

### 2. Run Missed Tasks ASAP
**Change:** Added `/Z` flag to Windows Task Scheduler task creation.

**Location:** `create_scheduled_task()` function in `nextcloud_restore_and_backup-v9.py`

**Impact:**
- If the computer is off or asleep at the scheduled backup time, the task will run as soon as possible after the system is available
- Ensures backups are not skipped due to system downtime
- Provides better backup coverage and reliability

**Behavior:**
- If scheduled time is 2:00 AM and computer is off, task runs when computer turns on
- Task runs immediately upon system availability, not waiting for next scheduled time
- Logged in Task Scheduler history

### 3. Backup History Tracking for Scheduled Backups
**Change:** Added backup history database tracking to scheduled backup execution.

**Location:** `run_backup_process_scheduled()` function in `nextcloud_restore_and_backup-v9.py`

**Impact:**
- Scheduled backups are now recorded in the backup history database
- "Backup History" button on main page shows recent scheduled backups immediately
- Backups include metadata: timestamp, size, database type, folders, encryption status
- Marked with "Scheduled backup" note to distinguish from manual backups

**Technical Details:**
```python
# Add backup to history
folders_list = ['config', 'data'] + [f for f in copied_folders if f not in ['config', 'data']]
backup_id = self.backup_history.add_backup(
    backup_path=final_file,
    database_type=dbtype,
    folders=folders_list,
    encrypted=bool(encrypt and encryption_password),
    notes="Scheduled backup"
)
```

## Verification

### How to Verify Changes

#### 1. Verify Task Scheduler Settings (Windows Only)
After creating a scheduled backup:
1. Open Windows Task Scheduler
2. Navigate to Task Scheduler Library
3. Find your scheduled task (e.g., "NextcloudBackup")
4. Right-click â†’ Properties
5. Go to "General" tab
6. Verify "Run with highest privileges" is checked
7. Go to "Settings" tab
8. Verify "Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed" is checked

#### 2. Verify Backup History Tracking
After a scheduled backup runs:
1. Open the Nextcloud Restore & Backup Utility
2. Click "ðŸ“œ Backup History" button on main page
3. Verify the most recent backup appears in the list
4. Check that it shows:
   - Correct timestamp
   - File size
   - Database type
   - Encryption status (if applicable)
   - Note: "Scheduled backup"

#### 3. Run Automated Tests
```bash
# Test scheduled task flags
python3 test_scheduled_backup_enhancements.py

# Test integration
python3 test_integration_scheduled_enhancements.py

# Test existing functionality
python3 test_scheduled_backup.py
```

## Compatibility

- **Windows:** Full support for all features
- **Linux/Mac:** Task scheduling features not available (as before)
- **Docker:** No changes to Docker integration

## Testing

### Test Files
1. `test_scheduled_backup_enhancements.py` - Unit tests for new features
2. `test_integration_scheduled_enhancements.py` - Integration tests
3. `test_scheduled_backup.py` - Existing tests (still passing)

### Test Coverage
- âœ… Task creation includes `/RL HIGHEST` flag
- âœ… Task creation includes `/Z` flag
- âœ… Flags are properly positioned in command
- âœ… Scheduled backup adds to backup history
- âœ… History tracking occurs after successful backup
- âœ… All required parameters passed to history database
- âœ… Backup history display shows all backups
- âœ… Existing functionality unaffected
- âœ… No breaking changes introduced

## Benefits

1. **Better Reliability:** Tasks run with appropriate permissions and won't be skipped
2. **Better Visibility:** All backups (manual and scheduled) appear in backup history
3. **Better Tracking:** Can verify scheduled backups are running as expected
4. **Better Recovery:** Can see all available backup points in one place
5. **Better User Experience:** No need to check file system to verify scheduled backups ran

## Technical Notes

### Windows Task Scheduler Flags Used

| Flag | Purpose | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| `/RL HIGHEST` | Run level | Task runs with highest available privileges |
| `/Z` | Run after missed | Task runs ASAP if scheduled time was missed |
| `/F` | Force | Overwrites existing task with same name |

### Database Schema
No changes to database schema were required. The existing `BackupHistoryManager` class supports all necessary fields:
- `backup_path` - Full path to backup file
- `timestamp` - When backup was created
- `size_bytes` - Size of backup file
- `encrypted` - Whether backup is encrypted
- `database_type` - Type of database (pgsql, mysql, sqlite)
- `folders_backed_up` - List of folders included
- `notes` - Custom notes (used to mark scheduled backups)

## Future Enhancements

Possible future improvements:
- Email notifications when scheduled backups complete
- Configurable retention policy for scheduled backups
- Scheduled backup statistics and reporting
- Cloud backup integration for scheduled backups

## Troubleshooting

### Backup History Not Showing Scheduled Backups
1. Verify the scheduled task actually ran (check Task Scheduler history)
2. Check the log file at `Documents/NextcloudLogs/nextcloud_restore_gui.log`
3. Run a test backup using the app's "Test Backup" feature
4. Verify Docker is running when scheduled task executes

### Task Not Running with Highest Privileges
1. User account must have administrator rights
2. UAC may prompt for permission on first run
3. Verify in Task Scheduler Properties â†’ General tab

### Task Not Running After Missed Schedule
1. Verify `/Z` flag in task properties
2. Check Task Scheduler history for missed task entries
3. Ensure system allows scheduled tasks to wake computer (if needed)
