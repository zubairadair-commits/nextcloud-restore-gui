# Docker Auto-Start Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

This update removes the "Docker Not Running" dialog from the restore and new instance workflows. Instead of showing a popup dialog when Docker is not running, the application now automatically attempts to start Docker Desktop (on Windows/macOS) silently in the background.

### Modified Files

1. **src/nextcloud_restore_and_backup-v9.py**
   - Modified `check_docker_running()` method (lines 4090-4141)
   - Modified `start_docker_desktop()` function (lines 1522-1543)

### Key Changes

#### Before
- When Docker was not running, a dialog would appear with buttons to:
  - "Start Docker Desktop" 
  - "Retry"
  - "Cancel"
- User had to manually interact with the dialog
- Required 3 retry attempts with manual intervention

#### After
- When Docker is not running, the app automatically:
  1. Detects Docker status
  2. Attempts to start Docker Desktop (if available)
  3. Waits up to 30 seconds for Docker to become available
  4. Shows status in the main UI status label (no popup)
- Only shows error messages in the status label if:
  - Docker Desktop could not be started
  - Docker didn't start within 30 seconds
  - Docker is not installed

### Behavior by Platform

**Windows/macOS:**
- Automatically launches Docker Desktop if found
- Waits for Docker daemon to be ready
- Silent operation unless there's a failure

**Linux:**
- Gracefully handles absence of Docker Desktop
- Shows clear error message asking user to start Docker daemon manually
- Provides platform-specific instructions in the error message

### Error Handling

All error messages are now displayed in the main UI status label using theme-aware colors:
- Uses `theme_colors['error_fg']` for error messages
- Integrates with existing theme system (light/dark mode)
- Non-intrusive, doesn't block user interaction

### Logging

All Docker startup attempts are logged:
- Info level: Startup attempts and successes
- Debug level: Wait iterations
- Error level: Failures and timeouts

### Testing

Created comprehensive tests to validate the new behavior:
- `tests/test_auto_docker_start.py` - Unit tests for auto-start scenarios
- All existing Docker detection tests still pass
- No regressions in Docker status detection

### Security

- No security vulnerabilities introduced (verified with CodeQL)
- No changes to Docker execution permissions
- Uses existing subprocess creation flags for security

## Benefits

1. **Streamlined UX**: No dialog interrupts the workflow
2. **Faster**: Automatic startup saves user clicks and time
3. **Silent**: Only shows errors when necessary
4. **Platform-aware**: Handles Windows, macOS, and Linux correctly
5. **Maintains compatibility**: Existing Docker detection logic unchanged

## Backward Compatibility

- The `prompt_start_docker()` function remains in the code but is no longer called
- All existing Docker detection functions work as before
- No breaking changes to the API
