# UI Changes: Backup History and Cloud Storage Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the UI/UX improvements made to the Backup History and Scheduled Backup pages, focusing on cleaner presentation and on-demand help.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Removed "Last Run Status" Box ✅

**Location:** Schedule Backup Configuration page  
**Status:** Completed

#### Before
The Schedule Backup page displayed a large "Last Run Status" box showing:
- Task status (Ready/Running/Error)
- Last run timestamp
- Next scheduled run timestamp
- Recent backup file information (name, size, age)
- "View Recent Logs" button

This took up significant vertical space and duplicated information available in Backup History.

#### After
- Section completely removed from Schedule Backup page
- All backup details (including scheduled backups) are now visible in the Backup History list
- Users navigate to Backup History via "📜 Backup History" button from landing page
- Backup History shows all backups with full details, sorted by most recent first

#### Benefits
- **Cleaner UI:** Less clutter on Schedule Backup Configuration page
- **Single Source of Truth:** All backup information consolidated in Backup History
- **Better UX:** Users know exactly where to find backup information
- **Reduced Redundancy:** Same information not shown in multiple places

```

                         Click for setup guide!

- Could not be dismissed

#### After
- Guide appears in modal dialog only when requested
- Dialog specifications:
  - **Size:** 600x500 pixels
  - **Position:** Centered on screen
  - **Modal:** Blocks interaction with main window (focused help)
  - **Dismissible:** Easy to close with button

    dialog.geometry("600x500")
    
    # Make modal
    dialog.transient(self)
    dialog.grab_set()
    
    # Center on screen
    x = (dialog.winfo_screenwidth() // 2) - (600 // 2)
    y = (dialog.winfo_screenheight() // 2) - (500 // 2)
    dialog.geometry(f"600x500+{x}+{y}")
    
    # Add scrollable content with setup instructions
