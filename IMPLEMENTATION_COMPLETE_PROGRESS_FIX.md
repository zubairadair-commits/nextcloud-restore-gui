## üéØ Problem & Solution

### Problem Statement
During the restore workflow, when the bulk Docker copy operation (`docker cp`) executed to transfer files from the staging area to the Docker container, the progress bar would freeze at approximately 70% and remain stuck during the "Transferring to Docker container..." step. This occurred because the `subprocess.run()` call was blocking the restore thread, preventing any UI updates during potentially long-running transfer operations.

**User Impact:**
- Progress bar appeared frozen/hung
- No visual indication work was being performed
- Users couldn't tell if application had crashed
- High anxiety and support requests

### Solution Implemented
Implemented an indeterminate progress bar mode with background threading:

1. **Indeterminate Mode:** Progress bar switches to animated marquee mode during bulk transfer
2. **Background Threading:** Docker cp runs in separate thread, keeping UI responsive
3. **Periodic Updates:** Main thread polls every 100ms and calls `update_idletasks()`
4. **Automatic Switching:** Progress bar automatically returns to determinate mode after completion

**Code Flow:**
```
1. Robocopy completes ‚Üí 70% progress
2. Switch progress bar to indeterminate mode
3. Start animation (10ms interval)
4. Launch docker cp in background thread
5. Main thread polls completion (100ms)
6. Keep UI responsive with update_idletasks()
7. Docker cp completes
8. Stop animation
9. Switch back to determinate mode
10. Continue to 100% completion
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Key Components

**1. Mode Switching Functions**
```python
def switch_to_indeterminate():
    """Switch progress bar to indeterminate (animated) mode"""
    - Changes mode to 'indeterminate'
    - Starts animation with 10ms interval
    - Uses safe_widget_update() for thread safety

def switch_to_determinate():
    """Switch progress bar back to determinate mode"""
    - Stops the animation
    - Changes mode back to 'determinate'
    - Restores normal progress percentage display
```

**2. Background Thread Execution**
```python
def run_docker_cp():
    """Run docker cp in background thread"""
    - Executes subprocess in separate thread
    - Stores result in thread-safe dictionary
    - Signals completion via threading.Event
```

**3. Main Thread Monitoring**
```python
while not docker_cp_complete.is_set():
    docker_cp_complete.wait(timeout=0.1)  # Check every 100ms
    if self.winfo_exists():
        self.update_idletasks()  # Keep UI responsive
```

### Thread Safety Measures
- ‚úÖ `threading.Event` for synchronization
- ‚úÖ Thread-safe result dictionary
- ‚úÖ `self.after(0, callback)` for UI updates
- ‚úÖ `safe_widget_update()` helper function
- ‚úÖ No shared mutable state

## ‚úÖ Testing & Verification

### Unit Tests (100% Pass Rate)

**Test 1: Mode Switching Logic**
```python
test_progress_bar_mode_switching()
‚úÖ PASSED - Verifies correct mode transitions
```

**Test 2: Background Thread Execution**
```python
test_background_thread_execution()
‚úÖ PASSED - Validates non-blocking operation
```

**Test 3: UI Responsiveness**
```python
test_ui_update_during_copy()
‚úÖ PASSED - Confirms continuous UI updates
```

**Test 4: Progress Bar Updates**
```python
test_progressbar_update_fix()
‚úÖ PASSED - Existing test still passes
```

### Visual Demonstration
```bash
python3 tests/demo_indeterminate_progress.py
‚úÖ Successfully demonstrates:
   - Determinate progress (0-70%)
   - Indeterminate animation during bulk copy
   - 30+ UI updates during 3-second operation
   - Smooth return to determinate mode
   - Before/after comparison
```

### Security Verification

CodeQL Analysis: 0 alerts found
Manual Review: PASSED
Thread Safety: VERIFIED
Resource Management: VERIFIED
Error Handling: VERIFIED
