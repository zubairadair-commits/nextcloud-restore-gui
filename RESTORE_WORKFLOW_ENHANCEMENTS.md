# Beginner-Friendly Restore Workflow Enhancements

This document describes the major improvements made to the Nextcloud restore workflow to make it more accessible and automated for beginner users.

## Overview

The restore workflow has been significantly enhanced to eliminate manual Docker operations and provide a streamlined, one-click experience. Users no longer need to:
- Manually edit YAML files
- Run Docker commands from the terminal
- Understand container networking
- Configure database connections manually

## New Features

### 1. One-Click Restore üöÄ

The entire restore process now runs automatically with a single button click. When users click "Start Restore" on the wizard's final page, the application:

- ‚úÖ **Automatically generates docker-compose.yml** based on detected database configuration
- ‚úÖ **Creates all required Docker volumes and networks**
- ‚úÖ **Decrypts and extracts backup files** with progress feedback
- ‚úÖ **Starts database and Nextcloud containers** without user intervention
- ‚úÖ **Copies all files** (config, data, apps) to containers
- ‚úÖ **Restores the database** using the appropriate method (SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- ‚úÖ **Updates configuration files** with correct credentials
- ‚úÖ **Sets proper file permissions** for the web server
- ‚úÖ **Validates the installation** to ensure everything is correct

### 2. Enhanced Docker Detection üê≥

#### Installation Check
Before starting a restore, the app now checks if Docker is installed:
- If Docker is missing, shows an installation dialog with a direct download link
- Provides clear instructions for installation
- Allows users to retry after installing

#### Runtime Check
The app verifies Docker is running before proceeding:
- Detects if Docker Desktop/daemon is not running
- Offers to automatically start Docker Desktop (Windows/Mac)
- Provides retry options with helpful feedback

### 3. Post-Restore Success Dialog üéâ

After a successful restore, users see a completion screen featuring:

- **Success confirmation** with clear visual feedback
- **Container information** (name and port)
- **"Open Nextcloud in Browser" button** - One click to launch Nextcloud
- **Return to Main Menu** option for further actions

Example:
```
‚úÖ Restore Complete!

Your Nextcloud instance has been successfully restored from backup.

Container: nextcloud-app
Port: 9000

[üåê Open Nextcloud in Browser]
[Return to Main Menu]
```

### 4. Intelligent Error Handling ‚ùå‚û°Ô∏è‚úÖ

When restore fails, the app now provides:

#### Actionable Error Messages
Instead of generic errors, users see specific suggestions:

**Docker Errors:**
- "Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system"
- "Try starting Docker Desktop manually"
- "Check Docker service status: 'docker ps' in terminal"

**Password Errors:**
- "Verify you entered the correct decryption password"
- "Check if the backup file is corrupted"
- "Ensure GPG is installed for encrypted backups"

**Database Errors:**
- "Verify database credentials match your original setup"
- "Check if the database container is running"
- "Ensure database dump file exists in backup"

**Permission Errors:**
- "Run the application with appropriate permissions"
- "Check file and folder permissions on your system"
- "Ensure Docker has access to required directories"

#### Error Recovery Options
The error dialog includes:
- **View Logs** button to see detailed error information
- **Try Again** button to retry the restore
- **Return to Main Menu** to start over

### 5. Step-by-Step Visual Progress üìä

The restore wizard now shows detailed progress at each step:

**Page 1: Backup Selection**
- Info box explaining "Quick Restore Mode"
- Default backup location hints
- Clear instructions for encrypted backups

**Page 2: Database Configuration**
- Auto-detection information
- SQLite detection message (no credentials needed)
- Pre-filled default values with verification tips

**Page 3: Container Configuration**
- Comprehensive list of automated steps
- "No manual Docker commands required!" message
- Clear explanation of what happens during restore

**During Restore:**
Progress bar with real-time updates:
```
[‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë] 75%

Updating Nextcloud configuration...
‚úì Configuration updated successfully
```

Step-by-step process labels:
1. Decrypting/extracting backup ‚úì
2. Generating Docker configuration ‚úì
3. Setting up containers ‚úì
4. Copying files into container (in progress...)
5. Restoring database
6. Setting permissions
7. Restore complete!

### 6. Automated YAML Generation üìù

The app automatically generates a docker-compose.yml file during restore:

**Features:**
- Detects database type from backup (SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Uses credentials provided in wizard
- Configures correct ports and networking
- Adds helpful comments and documentation
- Saves to current directory for reference

**Example Generated YAML:**
```yaml
# Docker Compose configuration for Nextcloud
# Generated based on config.php settings from backup
#
# Detected configuration:
#   - Database type: pgsql
#   - Database name: nextcloud
#   - Data directory: /var/www/html/data
#   - Trusted domains: localhost
#
# To start: docker-compose up -d
# To stop: docker-compose down

version: '3.8'

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    container_name: nextcloud-db
    ...
```

### 7. Default Path Suggestions üí°

To minimize user choices:

**Backup Location:**
- Shows hint: "üí° Tip: Default backup location is usually in Documents/NextcloudBackups"
- Remembers last used paths
- Provides sensible defaults

**Container Settings:**
- Pre-fills common container names
- Suggests standard ports (9000, 8080)
- Uses safe defaults throughout

### 8. Beginner-Friendly UI Enhancements üé®
