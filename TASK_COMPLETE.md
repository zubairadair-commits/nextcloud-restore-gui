# âœ… Task Complete: Remote Access Page Improvements

## Summary
Both issues from the problem statement have been successfully resolved:

### âœ… Issue 1: Remote Access Setup Page Now Scrollable
The Remote Access configuration page (`_show_tailscale_config`) is now fully scrollable with mouse wheel on all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).

**Technical Changes**:
- Fixed mouse wheel event handler to use correct `event.delta/120` calculation
- Changed from `bind_all()` to `bind()` to prevent conflicts with other pages
- Added bindings to both canvas and content frames for complete coverage
- Applied fixes to both main canvas and nested domain list canvas

### âœ… Issue 2: Command Prompt Windows No Longer Flash
Windows users will no longer see flashing command prompt windows during Remote Access operations.

**Technical Changes**:
- Added `creationflags=get_subprocess_creation_flags()` to `_get_tailscale_info()` function
- This was the only missing subprocess call (all others already had this flag)
- The flag returns `CREATE_NO_WINDOW (0x08000000)` on Windows, `0` on other platforms
