## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### 1. GUI Integration
```
Landing Page:
├── 🔄 Backup Now (existing)
├── 🛠 Restore from Backup (existing)
├── ✨ Start New Nextcloud Instance (existing)
├── 📅 Schedule Backup ← NEW!
└── Status: "📅 Scheduled: daily at 02:00" ← NEW!
```

**Schedule Configuration Screen:**
- Current status display
- Backup directory selection with browse button
- Frequency selection (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Time picker (HH:MM format)
- Encryption toggle with password field
- Enable/Disable/Delete buttons for existing schedules

### 2. Backend Functions

#### Schedule Management
```python
create_scheduled_task()      # Create Windows scheduled task
delete_scheduled_task()      # Remove scheduled task
get_scheduled_task_status()  # Query task status
enable_scheduled_task()      # Enable existing task
disable_scheduled_task()     # Disable existing task
```

#### Configuration
```python
get_schedule_config_path()   # Get config file location
load_schedule_config()       # Load saved configuration
save_schedule_config()       # Persist configuration
get_exe_path()              # Get app executable path
```

#### Execution
```python
run_scheduled_backup()           # Entry point for scheduled mode
run_backup_process_scheduled()   # Silent backup execution
```

### 3. Command-Line Interface
```bash
# Run scheduled backup
app.exe --scheduled --backup-dir "C:\Backups"

# With encryption
app.exe --scheduled --backup-dir "C:\Backups" --encrypt --password "secret"

# Without encryption
app.exe --scheduled --backup-dir "C:\Backups" --no-encrypt
```

### 4. Configuration Storage
Location: `%USERPROFILE%\.nextcloud_backup\schedule_config.json`

Example:
```json
{
  "task_name": "NextcloudBackup",
  "backup_dir": "C:\\Backups",
  "frequency": "daily",
  "time": "02:00",
  "encrypt": true,
  "password": "encrypted_password",
  "enabled": true,
  "created_at": "2025-10-12T22:30:00"
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Windows Task Scheduler Integration

**Creating a Task:**
```python
schtasks /Create 
  /TN "NextcloudBackup" 
  /TR "C:\path\to\app.exe --scheduled --backup-dir C:\Backups" 
  /ST 02:00 
  /SC DAILY 
  /F
```

**Querying Status:**
```python
schtasks /Query /TN "NextcloudBackup" /FO LIST /V
```

**Enabling/Disabling:**
```python
schtasks /Change /TN "NextcloudBackup" /ENABLE
schtasks /Change /TN "NextcloudBackup" /DISABLE
```

**Deleting:**
```python
schtasks /Delete /TN "NextcloudBackup" /F
```

### Silent Execution

All subprocess calls use the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag:
```python
creation_flags = 0x08000000  # CREATE_NO_WINDOW on Windows
subprocess.run(..., creationflags=creation_flags, ...)
```

This ensures:
- No console windows appear
- Silent background operation
- No user interaction required

### Backup Process Flow

**Scheduled Mode:**
```
Task Scheduler triggers
    ↓
App launches with --scheduled flag
    ↓
GUI hidden (withdraw())
    ↓
Check Docker running
    ↓
Find Nextcloud container
    ↓
Detect database type
    ↓
Run backup (console logging only)
    ↓
Save to configured directory
    ↓
Apply encryption (if enabled)
    ↓
Exit silently
```

**Manual Mode (unchanged):**
```
User clicks "Backup Now"
    ↓
Docker check with GUI feedback
    ↓
Select backup directory
    ↓
Container detection
    ↓
Database detection with user prompts
    ↓
Encryption password prompt
    ↓
Backup with progress bar
    ↓
Success dialog
```

## 🎯 User Experience Improvements

### Before This Feature
❌ No way to schedule backups  
❌ Manual backup required  
❌ User must remember to backup  
❌ No automation possible  

### After This Feature
✅ Fully automated backups  
✅ Set-and-forget operation  
✅ GUI-based configuration  
✅ No Task Scheduler expertise needed  
✅ Visual status indicators  
✅ Easy schedule management

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Password Storage
- Stored in `~/.nextcloud_backup/schedule_config.json`
- Plain text (OS-level security)
- User-only file permissions
- **Recommendation**: Use strong passwords

### Scheduled Execution
- No console windows (CREATE_NO_WINDOW)
- Runs with user privileges
- No elevation required
- Logs to console for monitoring

### Best Practices
1. Use encryption for sensitive data
2. Store backups on encrypted drives
3. Limit backup directory access
4. Regular integrity checks
5. Test restore procedures
