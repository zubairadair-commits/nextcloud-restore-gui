## üöÄ Creating Your First Scheduled Backup

### Step 1: Open Schedule Backup

1. Launch Nextcloud Restore & Backup Utility
2. Click **"üìÖ Schedule Backup"** button on main screen

### Step 2: Configure Settings

1. **Choose Backup Directory**
   - Click **Browse** button
   - Select where you want backups saved
   - TIP: Use a cloud sync folder (OneDrive, Google Drive) for automatic cloud backup

2. **Select Frequency**
   - Choose: Daily, Weekly, or Monthly
   - Daily is recommended for critical data

3. **Set Backup Time**
   - Enter time in 24-hour format (HH:MM)
   - Example: 02:00 for 2 AM, 14:30 for 2:30 PM
   - NOTE: Time is in your local system timezone

4. **Configure Encryption** (Optional)
   - Check "Encrypt backups" if desired
   - Enter a strong password
   - IMPORTANT: Remember this password - you'll need it to restore!

### Step 3: Test Your Configuration (Recommended)

Before creating the schedule, test it works:

1. Click **"üß™ Test Run"** button
2. Wait for test to complete (a few seconds)
3. Review the result:
   - ‚úÖ Success: Configuration is correct, proceed to create schedule
   - ‚ùå Failure: Fix the reported issue and test again

**Example Success Message**:
```
‚úì Test backup successful!

Test file created: test_backup_20241014_150530.tar.gz
Size: 234 bytes
Location: C:\Backups\Nextcloud

Your scheduled backup configuration is working correctly.
```

### Step 4: Create the Schedule

1. Click **"Create/Update Schedule"** button
2. **Automatic validation runs** - please wait
3. Review validation results dialog:
   - ‚úÖ All checks passed: Click **Yes** to proceed
   - ‚ùå Some checks failed: Click **OK**, fix issues, try again

**Example Validation Success**:
```
‚úÖ All Validation Checks Passed

‚úì Executable path exists
‚úì Start directory is valid
‚úì Task arguments are correct
‚úì Backup directory is writable
‚úì Log file is writable
‚úì Task fields are valid

Proceed with creating the scheduled task?
```

4. If validation passes, confirm creation
5. Task is created successfully!

## üìä Monitoring Your Scheduled Backups

### Check Last Run Status

After your first scheduled backup runs:

1. Open **Schedule Backup** screen
2. Look for **"üìä Last Run Status"** section
3. Review information:
   - When last backup ran
   - When next backup is scheduled
   - Most recent backup file details

**Example Display**:
```
Status: Ready
Last Run: 2024-10-14 02:00:15
Next Run: 2024-10-15 02:00:00

‚úì Recent Backup Found:
  File: nextcloud_backup_20241014_020015.tar.gz
  Created: 2024-10-14 02:00:45
  Size: 125.67 MB
  Age: 13.1 hours ago
```

### View Logs

To see what happened during backups:

1. In Last Run Status section, click **"üìÑ View Recent Logs"**
2. Review log entries:
   - SCHEDULED: Scheduled backup events
   - VALIDATION: Validation checks
   - TEST RUN: Test backup runs
3. Look for errors or warnings
4. Click **Close** when done

### Verify Backup is Working

To confirm scheduled backup is functioning:

1. Click **"üîç Verify Scheduled Backup"** button
2. Wait for verification to complete
3. Review results:
   - ‚úÖ Success: Everything working correctly
   - ‚ö† Warning: Backup old or no recent logs
   - ‚ùå Failure: No recent backup found

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Validation Fails - "Backup directory is not writable"

**Solution**:
1. Check the directory exists
2. Right-click directory ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Security
3. Ensure your user has "Modify" permission
4. Try a different directory (e.g., Documents folder)

### Issue: Test Run Fails

**Solution**:
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check backup directory path is correct
3. Ensure enough disk space available
4. Try disabling encryption temporarily
5. Click "View Recent Logs" for details

### Issue: No Recent Backup Found

**Solution**:
1. Open Windows Task Scheduler:
   - Press Win+R, type `taskschd.msc`, press Enter
2. Find task named **"NextcloudBackup"**
3. Check:
   - Task is Enabled
   - Last Run Time shows recent execution
   - Last Run Result is 0x0 (success)
4. If task never ran:
   - Right-click task ‚Üí Run
   - Check for errors
5. Review logs for error messages

### Issue: Invalid Time Format

**Solution**:
- Use 24-hour format: HH:MM
- Valid examples: 00:00, 02:00, 14:30, 23:59
- Invalid examples: 25:00, 2:00, 14:60

## üí° Best Practices

### 1. Test First
Always click "Test Run" before creating schedule. This catches issues immediately.

### 2. Use Cloud Sync
Select a cloud sync folder (OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox) as backup destination for automatic cloud backup.

### 3. Choose Off-Peak Time
Schedule backups during low-usage periods:
- 2:00 AM for home users
- After business hours for office systems

### 4. Enable Encryption
For sensitive data:
1. Check "Encrypt backups"
2. Use a strong password
3. Store password securely (password manager)

### 5. Regular Verification
Once a week:
1. Open Schedule Backup screen
2. Check Last Run Status
3. Click "Verify Scheduled Backup"
4. Confirm backup is recent and logs look good

### 6. Monitor Disk Space
- Check backup directory has sufficient space
- Delete old backups when disk space low
- Consider backup retention policy

### 7. Test Restore
Periodically:
1. Use "Restore from Backup" feature
2. Test with an old backup
3. Ensure restore process works

## ‚öôÔ∏è Understanding Validation Checks

### What Gets Validated

1. **Executable Path** ‚úì
   - Confirms backup program exists
   - Ensures path is accessible

2. **Start Directory** ‚úì
   - Verifies program's parent folder is valid
   - Required for Task Scheduler

3. **Task Arguments** ‚úì
   - Checks all required arguments present
   - Validates argument format

4. **Backup Directory** ‚úì
   - Tests directory exists
   - Verifies write permissions
   - Creates test file to confirm

5. **Log File** ‚úì
   - Ensures log directory accessible
   - Tests log write capability

6. **Task Fields** ‚úì
   - Validates schedule type (daily/weekly/monthly)
   - Checks time format (HH:MM)
   - Ensures task name not empty

### Why Validation Matters

**Without validation**:
- Task created but fails silently
- No backups despite thinking you're protected
- Issues discovered only when you need restore

**With validation**:
- Issues caught immediately
- Fix before task creation
- Confidence in backup reliability
