# Tailscale Detection - User Guide

## What Changed?

The Nextcloud Restore GUI now **automatically detects** Tailscale installation on Windows, no matter how you installed it!

## Why This Matters

**Before:**
- App only found Tailscale if it was in your system PATH
- Some installation methods didn't add Tailscale to PATH
- Users saw "Not Installed" even when Tailscale was installed
- Had to manually troubleshoot

**After:**
- App checks multiple locations automatically
- Works with all installation methods
- Accurate installation status
- Just works! ‚úì

## How It Works

The app now intelligently searches for Tailscale in three places:

### 1. System PATH
First, it checks if `tailscale.exe` is in your system PATH (the quick check).

### 2. Common Installation Folders
If not found in PATH, it checks these standard locations:
- `C:\Program Files\Tailscale`
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Tailscale`
- Your user's `AppData\Local\Tailscale` folder

### 3. Windows Registry
If still not found, it checks the Windows registry for Tailscale's installation path.

## What You'll See

### When Tailscale IS Installed

In the Remote Access Setup page, you'll see:

```
üåê Remote Access Setup

Tailscale Installation: ‚úì Installed
Tailscale Status: ‚úì Running  (or ‚úó Not Running)

[‚öôÔ∏è Configure Remote Access]  ‚Üê Button to set up access
```

### When Tailscale is NOT Installed

```
üåê Remote Access Setup

Tailscale Installation: ‚úó Not Installed

[üì¶ Install Tailscale]  ‚Üê Button to download installer
```

## Supported Installation Methods

‚úì **MSI Installer** (official download)
‚úì **Microsoft Store** version
‚úì **Portable/ZIP** installation
‚úì **Custom directory** installation
‚úì **Chocolatey** package manager
‚úì **Scoop** package manager
‚úì **WinGet** package manager

All installation methods are now detected correctly!

## Troubleshooting

### Q: I installed Tailscale but the app says "Not Installed"

**A:** Try these steps:
1. Close and reopen the Nextcloud Restore GUI app
2. Verify Tailscale is actually installed (look for it in Start Menu)
3. Try clicking "Refresh" if available
4. Check if `tailscale.exe` exists in:
   - `C:\Program Files\Tailscale`
   - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Tailscale`

### Q: The app detects Tailscale but says "Not Running"

**A:** This is normal! It means:
- ‚úì Tailscale **is** installed correctly
- ‚úó Tailscale service is not currently running

**To fix:** Click the "‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start Tailscale" button or start it from your system tray.

### Q: I moved Tailscale to a custom folder

**A:** The app will try to find it! If you installed Tailscale:
1. Make sure it's properly installed (not just extracted files)
2. The registry should have the installation path
3. Restart the Nextcloud Restore GUI app

## For Advanced Users

### Detection Order

The app checks locations in this order:
1. System PATH (fastest)
2. Standard directories (most common)
3. Windows Registry (most reliable)

### What Gets Detected

The app looks specifically for `tailscale.exe` (the CLI tool), not the Tailscale system tray app or service.

### Registry Keys Checked

- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Tailscale IPN`
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Tailscale IPN` (32-bit on 64-bit)
- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Tailscale IPN`

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use Official Installer**: The MSI installer from tailscale.com always works perfectly
2. **Restart After Installing**: Always restart the Nextcloud app after installing Tailscale
3. **Don't Move Files**: If you must move Tailscale, reinstall it properly instead
4. **Check System Tray**: The Tailscale icon in your system tray confirms it's installed

## Need Help?

If you're still having issues:

1. Check the app's log file:
   - Location: `Documents\NextcloudLogs\nextcloud_restore_gui.log`
   - Look for "Tailscale" entries to see what the app detected

2. Verify Tailscale installation:
   - Open Command Prompt
   - Type: `where tailscale`
   - If found, you'll see the path

3. Check Windows Settings:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Apps & features
   - Search for "Tailscale"
   - Verify it's listed
