# SQLite UI Improvements - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation successfully addresses the requirement to hide database credential fields when SQLite is detected in the Nextcloud restore workflow.

## Requirements Addressed ✅

- ✅ Read config/config.php and detect 'dbtype'
- ✅ If dbtype is 'sqlite' or 'sqlite3', hide input fields for database name, user, and password
- ✅ Show informational message: "No database credentials are needed for SQLite"
- ✅ Only show database credential fields if dbtype is 'mysql' or 'pgsql'
- ✅ Apply logic to both auto-detected and user-selected database types
- ✅ Add clear comments and documentation for future maintainers

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Early Detection Strategy

**Challenge:** The original implementation only detected database type during restore (at 18% progress), after users had already entered credentials.

**Solution:** Added early detection that extracts and parses `config/config.php` immediately when user selects a backup file.

**Method:** `early_detect_database_type_from_backup(backup_path)`
- Extracts only config.php from archive (fast)
- Parses PHP config using regex
- Returns detected database type
- Normalizes 'sqlite3' to 'sqlite'
- Handles encrypted backups gracefully (detection during restore instead)

### 2. Dynamic UI Management

**Challenge:** Need to show/hide multiple widgets based on detection without breaking layout.

**Solution:** Store references to all credential-related widgets and use `grid_remove()` for clean hiding.

**Method:** `update_database_credential_ui(dbtype)`
- Maintains list of 12 widgets to hide/show
- Uses `grid_remove()` to preserve layout
- Shows green SQLite message when applicable
- Hides SQLite message for MySQL/PostgreSQL

### 3. Widget Reference Storage

**Challenge:** Need to track all credential widgets created in `create_wizard_page2()`.

**Solution:** Store references during widget creation.

**Implementation:**
```python
self.db_credential_widgets = [
    warning_label,      # Red warning about original credentials
    instruction_label1, # Gray instruction text
    instruction_label2, # Gray instruction text  
    db_name_label,     # "Database Name:" label
    self.db_name_entry, # Name input field
    db_name_hint,      # Gray hint text
    db_user_label,     # "Database User:" label
    self.db_user_entry, # User input field
    db_user_hint,      # Gray hint text
    db_password_label, # "Database Password:" label
    self.db_password_entry, # Password input field
    db_password_hint   # Gray hint text
]
```

### 4. SQLite Information Message

**Challenge:** Need to clearly communicate why credentials aren't needed.

**Solution:** Created informative message with visual appeal.

**Implementation:**
- Green text (#2e7d32) on light green background (#e8f5e9)
- Checkmark icon (✓) for positive reinforcement
- Clear, concise explanation
- Styled as solid border panel
- Initially hidden, shown only when SQLite detected

### 5. Smart Validation

**Challenge:** Skip credential validation for SQLite without breaking other database types.

**Solution:** Check detected database type before validation.

**Implementation:**
```python
is_sqlite = self.detected_dbtype and self.detected_dbtype.lower() in ['sqlite', 'sqlite3']

if not is_sqlite:
    # Only validate for MySQL/PostgreSQL
    if not db_name:
        self.error_label.config(text="Error: Database name is required.")
        return
    # ... other validations
```

### 6. Integration with Browse Handler

**Challenge:** Trigger detection and UI update at the right time.

**Solution:** Enhanced `browse_backup()` to call detection after file selection.

**Flow:**
1. User selects backup file
2. File path inserted into entry field
3. Early detection triggered
4. Detection results stored
5. UI updated if on page 2 or page 2 is revisited

## Technical Details

### Database Type Normalization

Both `sqlite` and `sqlite3` are normalized to `sqlite`:

```python
if dbtype and dbtype.lower() in ['sqlite', 'sqlite3']:
    dbtype = 'sqlite'
    if db_config:
        db_config['dbtype'] = 'sqlite'
```

This normalization occurs in two places:
1. `early_detect_database_type_from_backup()` - Early detection
2. `_restore_auto_thread()` - Detection during restore

### Encryption Handling

For encrypted backups (.gpg):
- Early detection returns None (cannot extract without password)
- UI shows credential fields by default
- Detection happens during restore at 18% progress
- User-entered credentials are ignored for SQLite

### Layout Preservation

Using `grid_remove()` instead of `grid_forget()`:
- Preserves widget configuration
- Allows clean show/hide without re-gridding
- Maintains proper spacing and alignment

## Testing Performed

### Automated Testing ✅
- Python syntax validation
- Module compilation check
- Logic validation with test cases

### Manual Testing Recommended
1. SQLite backup detection
2. MySQL/PostgreSQL backup detection  
3. Encrypted backup handling
4. Wizard navigation state preservation
5. Validation behavior for each database type
