## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Where did the Test Run button go?
**A:** It moved from the "Configure New Schedule" section to the "Current Status" section, where it's grouped with other schedule management buttons.

### Q: Why is the Test Run button gray?
**A:** It's disabled because no schedule is configured. Create a schedule first, and the button will become blue and clickable.

### Q: What configuration does Test Run use?

### Q: Will Test Run show a pop-up?
**A:** No! All feedback appears inline on the same page. No blocking dialogs.

**A:** Yes! As soon as you create a schedule, the Test Run button becomes enabled (blue) and you can click it immediately.

### Q: What happens when I click Test Run?
**A:** It immediately runs a backup using your schedule configuration and shows you the results inline - success, error, or warnings.

### Q: How do I know if the test was successful?

### Q: What if the test fails?
**A:** You'll see a red error message (‚ùå) explaining what went wrong, so you can fix the issue before your scheduled backup runs.
