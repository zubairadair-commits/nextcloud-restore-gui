## Common Tasks

### Remove a Tailscale Domain

**Problem:** You changed your Tailscale IP and the old one is still trusted

**Solution:**
1. Go to Configure Remote Access
2. Find the old IP in Current Trusted Domains
3. Click ✕ next to it
4. Confirm removal
5. Old IP is removed ✓

### Add Multiple Domains

**Problem:** You have several custom domains to add

**Solution:**
1. Add first domain and click Apply
2. Page refreshes
3. Add second domain and click Apply
4. Repeat for all domains
5. All appear in Current Trusted Domains ✓

### Make Domains Persistent

**Problem:** Domains disappear after system reboot

**Solution:**
1. Click Setup Startup Automation
2. Follow installation steps
3. Reboot to test
4. Domains auto-applied on boot ✓

### Remove All Custom Domains

**Problem:** You want to reset to just localhost

2. Click ✕ for each custom domain
3. Confirm each removal
4. Only localhost remains ✓

## Tips 💡

### Tip 1: Check Before Removing
Always verify which domain you're removing. The confirmation dialog shows the domain name.

### Tip 2: Keep localhost
Don't remove `localhost` unless you know what you're doing. It's needed for local access.

### Tip 3: Use MagicDNS
Tailscale MagicDNS names (like `server.tailnet.ts.net`) are more stable than IPs.

### Tip 4: Test After Changes
After adding/removing domains, test access from a Tailscale device to confirm.

### Tip 5: Check Logs
If startup automation doesn't work, check logs:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u nextcloud-remote-access.service
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Content Not Centered
**Check:** Window width should be at least 700px  
**Fix:** Resize window or maximize it

### Issue: Can't Remove Domain
**Check:** Nextcloud container must be running  
**Fix:** Start your Nextcloud container first

### Issue: Domain List Empty
**Check:** Nextcloud container name must be correct  
**Fix:** Verify container is named `nextcloud` or similar

### Issue: Startup Automation Not Working
**Check:** Service must be enabled and started  
**Fix:** Run `sudo systemctl enable nextcloud-remote-access.service`

### Issue: No ✕ Buttons Visible
**Check:** You're on the Configure Remote Access page  
**Fix:** Click "Configure Remote Access" from main Tailscale page
