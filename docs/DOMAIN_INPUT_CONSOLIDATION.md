# Domain Input Consolidation and Mouse Wheel Scrolling Enhancement

## Summary

This implementation addresses the issue of having duplicate domain input sections and adds comprehensive mouse wheel scrolling support to the Configure Remote Access page.

## Problem Statement

1. **Duplicate Domain Input Sections**: The Configure Remote Access page had TWO places to add domains:
   - "Custom Domains (Optional)" section at the top
   - "Add New Domain" section below the trusted domains list
   This was confusing for users and created inconsistent UX.

2. **Missing Mouse Wheel Scrolling**: The page did not support mouse wheel scrolling, making it difficult to navigate when:
   - The window was small
   - Many domains were present
   - Content extended beyond the visible area

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Removed Duplicate "Add New Domain" Section

**File**: `nextcloud_restore_and_backup-v9.py`

**Lines Removed**: 5940-6001 (62 lines total)

**Removed Components**:
- "Add New Domain:" label
- Domain input entry field
- "➕ Add" button
- Real-time validation feedback label
- Validation function with trace binding

**Why This Improves UX**:
- Single, clear location to add domains (at the top)
- Reduces cognitive load for users
- Prevents confusion about which section to use
- Maintains all functionality through the top section

### 2. Updated Info Note Text

**Before**:
```
• Wildcard domains (*.example.com) are supported with warnings
```

**After**:
```
• Use the "Custom Domains (Optional)" section at the top to add new domains
```

**Why This Improves UX**:
- Explicitly guides users to the correct location for adding domains
- Clear call-to-action
- Reduces user confusion

### 3. Added Mouse Wheel Scrolling Support

#### Main Canvas Scrolling

**Location**: `_show_tailscale_config()` method (lines 5544-5557)

**Implementation**:
```python
def on_mouse_wheel(event):
    """Handle mouse wheel scrolling for the canvas"""
    # Windows and MacOS
    if event.num == 5 or event.delta < 0:
        canvas.yview_scroll(1, "units")
    if event.num == 4 or event.delta > 0:
        canvas.yview_scroll(-1, "units")

# Bind mouse wheel events (both Windows/Mac and Linux)
canvas.bind_all("<MouseWheel>", on_mouse_wheel)  # Windows and MacOS
canvas.bind_all("<Button-4>", on_mouse_wheel)    # Linux scroll up
canvas.bind_all("<Button-5>", on_mouse_wheel)    # Linux scroll down
```

**Platform Support**:
- ✓ Windows (via `<MouseWheel>` event)
- ✓ MacOS (via `<MouseWheel>` event)
- ✓ Linux (via `<Button-4>` and `<Button-5>` events)

#### Domain List Canvas Scrolling

**Location**: `_display_current_trusted_domains()` method (lines 5896-5910)

**Implementation**:
```python
def on_domain_mouse_wheel(event):
    """Handle mouse wheel scrolling for the domain list canvas"""
    # Windows and MacOS
    if event.num == 5 or event.delta < 0:
        canvas.yview_scroll(1, "units")
    if event.num == 4 or event.delta > 0:
        canvas.yview_scroll(-1, "units")

# Bind mouse wheel events for domain list
canvas.bind("<MouseWheel>", on_domain_mouse_wheel)  # Windows and MacOS
canvas.bind("<Button-4>", on_domain_mouse_wheel)    # Linux scroll up
canvas.bind("<Button-5>", on_domain_mouse_wheel)    # Linux scroll down
```

**Why This Improves UX**:
- Natural scrolling behavior users expect
- Works on all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Enables easy navigation of long domain lists
- Allows viewing all content regardless of window size

### 4. Updated Test Files

#### test_visual_responsive_domain_list.py
- Removed duplicate "Add New Domain" section
- Added mouse wheel scrolling bindings for both canvases
- Updated info note text

#### test_enhanced_domain_management.py
- Updated UI checks to reference "Custom Domains (Optional)"
- Changed from checking for "Add New Domain:" to "Custom Domains (Optional)"

#### test_layout_verification.py
- Updated visual mockup to show "(Use Custom Domains section above)"
- Removed reference to "Add New Domain: [input] [Add]"

## User Flow

### Before Changes

1. User sees "Custom Domains (Optional)" at top ❓
2. Scrolls down (no mouse wheel support) ❌
3. Sees "Add New Domain" section ❓
4. Confused about which section to use ❌
5. May add domain in wrong place ❌

### After Changes

1. User sees "Custom Domains (Optional)" at top ✓
2. Uses mouse wheel to scroll naturally ✓
3. Sees only domain removal options below ✓
4. Clear instruction to use top section ✓
5. Adds domain in the correct location ✓

## Technical Details

### Mouse Wheel Event Handling

**Event Types**:
- `<MouseWheel>`: Windows and MacOS mouse wheel events
  - `event.delta > 0`: Scroll up
  - `event.delta < 0`: Scroll down
- `<Button-4>`: Linux X11 scroll up event
- `<Button-5>`: Linux X11 scroll down event

**Scroll Amount**: 1 unit per wheel notch (standard Tkinter behavior)

**Binding Strategy**:
- Main canvas: `bind_all()` to capture events anywhere on the page
- Domain list canvas: `bind()` to capture events only when hovering over the list

### Code Metrics

**Lines Changed**: 158 lines across 4 files
- `nextcloud_restore_and_backup-v9.py`: -62 lines (removal) + 30 lines (mouse wheel) = -32 net
- `test_visual_responsive_domain_list.py`: -27 lines + 30 lines = +3 net
- `test_enhanced_domain_management.py`: 1 line change
- `test_layout_verification.py`: 1 line change

**Net Impact**: Cleaner code, better UX, more features

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

**Domain Input**:
- [ ] Only "Custom Domains (Optional)" section visible at top
- [ ] No "Add New Domain" section below trusted domains
- [ ] Info note guides users to top section
- [ ] Domain addition still works from top section

**Mouse Wheel Scrolling**:
- [ ] Main page scrolls with mouse wheel
- [ ] Works on Windows
- [ ] Works on MacOS
- [ ] Works on Linux
- [ ] Domain list scrolls independently with mouse wheel
- [ ] Smooth scrolling experience
- [ ] No conflicts between main and domain list scrolling

**Visual Verification**:
- [ ] UI layout remains clean and centered
- [ ] No visual regressions
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Domain removal still works
- [ ] Status indicators still visible
- [ ] Tooltips still functional

### Automated Testing

Run the visual test:
```bash
python3 test_mouse_wheel_scrolling.py
```

This will display a test window demonstrating:
1. Single domain input section at top
2. Mouse wheel scrolling on main canvas
3. Mouse wheel scrolling on domain list
4. Updated info note text
