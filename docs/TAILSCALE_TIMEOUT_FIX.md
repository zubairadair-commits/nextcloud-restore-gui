# Tailscale Network Info Retrieval Timeout Fix

## Overview
This fix resolves the issue where Tailscale network information retrieval times out with the error: "Tailscale command timed out. The service may be unresponsive." when Tailscale is running but takes longer than expected to respond.

## Problem
The original implementation had the following limitations:
1. Used a hardcoded `"tailscale"` string instead of `shutil.which()` for non-Windows systems, which could fail to locate the executable
2. Had a 5-second timeout that was insufficient for slower Tailscale responses
3. Limited error logging that made debugging difficult

## Solution
Updated the `_get_tailscale_info()` method in `src/nextcloud_restore_and_backup-v9.py` with:

### 1. Reliable Executable Detection
- **Windows**: Uses existing `_find_tailscale_exe()` method
- **Linux/macOS**: Now uses `shutil.which("tailscale")` instead of hardcoded string
- Returns clear error if executable is not found: "Tailscale CLI not found. Please ensure Tailscale is installed and in your PATH."

### 2. Increased Timeout
- Changed from `timeout=5` to `timeout=15` seconds
- Gives Tailscale adequate time to respond in slower network conditions
- Reduces false timeout errors when service is actually working

### 3. Enhanced Error Logging
- Added `logger.error()` calls for:
  - Timeout events
  - Command failures with full stderr output
  - JSON parsing errors
  - All unexpected errors
- Makes debugging much easier

### 4. Comprehensive Error Messages
All error scenarios now return detailed, actionable messages:
- CLI not found
- Command timeout
- Service not running
- Permission denied
- Not logged in
- Command failures (with full stderr)
- JSON parsing errors
- No network information available
- Missing 'Self' information
- Unexpected errors

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `src/nextcloud_restore_and_backup-v9.py`: Updated `_get_tailscale_info()` method (lines 9735-9822)

### Files Added
- `tests/test_tailscale_timeout_fix.py`: Automated test to verify all changes
- `tests/demo_tailscale_timeout_fix.py`: Interactive demo showcasing improvements
- `TAILSCALE_TIMEOUT_FIX.md`: This documentation

## Testing

### Automated Tests
All tests pass successfully:
- ✓ `test_tailscale_feature.py`: Existing Tailscale feature tests
- ✓ `test_tailscale_timeout_fix.py`: New verification test for timeout fix
- ✓ `demo_tailscale_timeout_fix.py`: Interactive demonstration

### Test Coverage
The new test verifies:
1. `shutil.which()` is used for executable detection
2. 15-second timeout is configured
3. Enhanced error logging is implemented
4. Detailed error messages are present
5. stderr output is captured and logged
6. Windows compatibility is maintained

### Security
- ✓ CodeQL security scan: 0 vulnerabilities found
- ✓ No new security risks introduced
- ✓ Follows security best practices

## Code Quality
- ✓ Minimal changes (only modified what's necessary)
- ✓ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✓ No breaking changes
- ✓ Clean, readable code
- ✓ Proper error handling
- ✓ Python syntax validated

## Impact
This fix will:
- Reduce or eliminate timeout errors when Tailscale is functioning correctly
- Provide better diagnostic information when issues occur
- Work reliably across different operating systems and Tailscale installations
- Make troubleshooting easier with comprehensive logging

## Compatibility
- **Windows**: Unchanged behavior, uses existing `_find_tailscale_exe()`
- **Linux**: Now uses `shutil.which()` for reliable detection
- **macOS**: Now uses `shutil.which()` for reliable detection
- **Dependencies**: No new dependencies (uses Python standard library)

## Example Scenarios

### Before Fix
```
User: Tailscale is running but I keep getting "command timed out" errors
Issue: 5-second timeout was too short for slow responses
```

### After Fix
```
User: Tailscale works reliably with 15-second timeout
Issue: Resolved - adequate time for service to respond
```

## Summary
The timeout fix addresses the core issue by:
1. Using `shutil.which()` for reliable executable location
2. Increasing timeout to 15 seconds
3. Adding comprehensive error logging
4. Providing detailed, actionable error messages

All changes are minimal, focused, and maintain full backward compatibility while significantly improving reliability and debuggability.
