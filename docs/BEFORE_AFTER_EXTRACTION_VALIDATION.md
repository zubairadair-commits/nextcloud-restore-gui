# Extraction Tool Validation - Before and After

## Before Implementation

### Scenario: User selects encrypted backup without GPG installed

```
User Actions:
1. User clicks "Browse..." and selects backup.tar.gz.gpg
2. User enters password
3. User clicks "Next" to go to Page 2

What Happens:
❌ Wizard shows Page 2 with all credential fields
❌ No clear indication that GPG is missing
❌ User fills in all credentials
❌ User clicks "Start Restore"
❌ Restore fails with cryptic error: "GPG decryption failed"
❌ User confused why it failed
❌ No guidance on how to fix

Result: Poor user experience, confusion, wasted time
```

## After Implementation

### Scenario: User selects encrypted backup without GPG installed

```
User Actions:
1. User clicks "Browse..." and selects backup.tar.gz.gpg

What Happens Immediately:
✓ System checks if GPG is available
✓ Detects GPG is missing
✓ Shows friendly error dialog:

   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │   ⚠️ Cannot Extract Backup Archive              │
   ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │                                                 │
   │ Required Tool: GPG (GNU Privacy Guard)         │
   │                                                 │
   │ Your backup file is encrypted (.gpg), but      │
   │ GPG is not installed.                           │
   │                                                 │
   │ GPG is required to decrypt encrypted backups.  │
   │                                                 │
   │ 📥 Installation Options:                        │
   │                                                 │
   │ • Click 'Install GPG' to download (Windows)    │
   │ • Linux: sudo apt install gpg                  │
   │ • Mac: brew install gnupg                      │
   │                                                 │
   │    [Install GPG]    [Cancel]                   │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

User Options:
A) Click "Install GPG"
   → Browser opens to GPG download page
   → User installs GPG
   → User tries again, now it works!

B) Click "Cancel"
   → Stays on Page 1
   → Can select different backup file

Result: Clear guidance, easy resolution, no wasted time
```

### Scenario: User clicks "Next" with encrypted backup

```
User Actions:
1. User has selected backup.tar.gz.gpg
2. User enters password
3. User clicks "Next"

What Happens:
✓ System validates GPG is available (checks again)
✓ System validates tarfile module is available
✓ If tools are missing:
   → Shows same helpful error dialog
   → Blocks navigation to Page 2
   → User fixes issue before proceeding

✓ If tools are available:
   → Attempts to decrypt and extract config.php
   → Detects database type
   → Shows Page 2 with appropriate fields
   
✓ If decryption fails (wrong password):
   → Shows specific error: "Incorrect password"
   → Suggests going back to re-enter password
   → Doesn't show generic "extraction failed" message

Result: Step-by-step validation, clear error messages
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Immediate Feedback
**Before:** Wait until restore attempt to discover missing tools
**After:** Know immediately when selecting backup file

### 2. Clear Error Messages
**Before:** "GPG decryption failed" (cryptic)
**After:** "GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) is not installed. GPG is required to decrypt encrypted backups." (clear)

### 3. Actionable Guidance
**Before:** No guidance on how to fix
**After:** Platform-specific installation instructions + automatic download option

### 4. Prevention
**Before:** User can proceed through all wizard pages before failing
**After:** User blocked at first step until issue is resolved

### 5. Multiple Validation Points
**Before:** Only validated during restore
**After:** Validated at file selection AND when clicking "Next"
