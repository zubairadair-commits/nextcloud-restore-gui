# Solution Summary: UI Alignment Fixes

## What Was Fixed

The restore wizard had **hardcoded width values** for input fields (Entry widgets) that caused alignment issues when the window was not at full screen size. Input fields would not resize properly with the window, causing them to appear misaligned or overflow.

## The Solution

We removed all hardcoded `width` parameters from Entry widgets and replaced them with **responsive layout patterns** that adapt to any window size:

### Pattern 1: Single Entry Fields
Used container frames with horizontal expansion:
```python
container = tk.Frame(parent)
container.pack(fill="x", padx=PADDING)  # Expands horizontally with padding

entry = tk.Entry(container)
entry.pack(fill="x", expand=True)  # Entry fills container width
```

### Pattern 2: Form Fields (Label-Entry Pairs)
Used grid layout with column weight configuration:
```python
frame = tk.Frame(parent)
frame.pack(fill="x", padx=50)

# Configure columns: labels fixed, entries expandable
frame.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=0)  # Label - fixed
frame.grid_columnconfigure(1, weight=1)  # Entry - expandable

entry = tk.Entry(frame)
entry.grid(row=0, column=1, sticky="ew")  # Expands east-west
```

## What Changed

### Before
- Backup entry: `width=70` (70 characters)
- Password entry: `width=40` (40 characters)  
- Database fields: `width=30` (30 characters each)
- Admin fields: `width=30` (30 characters each)
- Container fields: `width=30` (30 characters each)

### After
- **No hardcoded widths**
- All entries use responsive layout with `fill="x"` and `expand=True`
- Grid layouts use column weights for expandable columns
- Consistent padding values: `padx=50` (forms) or `padx=100` (single entries)

## Pages Updated

1. **Wizard Page 1** (Backup Selection & Decryption)
   - Backup archive path entry
   - Decryption password entry

2. **Wizard Page 2** (Database & Admin Credentials)
   - Database name, user, password entries
   - Admin username, password entries

3. **Wizard Page 3** (Container Configuration)
   - Container name entry
   - Container port entry

4. **Backup Workflow** (Encryption Password)
   - Backup encryption password entry

## Benefits

âœ… **Responsive**: Input fields now resize with the window  
âœ… **Centered**: All elements remain centered at any size  
âœ… **Clean**: Professional appearance in all modes  
âœ… **Consistent**: Same approach used across all pages  
âœ… **No hardcoded values**: More maintainable code  

## Testing

Run the application and try:
1. Resizing the window from minimum (600x700) to maximum
2. Observing that entry fields expand/contract smoothly
3. Verifying all elements stay centered
4. Checking that forms maintain proper alignment

The layout now adapts beautifully to any window size! ðŸŽ‰
