## Technical Changes
All changes were made using tkinter's `pack()` method with the `anchor="center"` parameter:

```python
# Example: Button centering
tk.Button(parent, text="Browse...", ...).pack(pady=5, anchor="center")

# Example: Label centering
tk.Label(parent, text="Step 1: ...", ...).pack(pady=(10, 5), anchor="center")

# Example: Frame centering (for form groups)
db_frame.pack(pady=10, anchor="center")
```

## Conclusion
The centered layout provides a more polished, professional appearance while maintaining all functionality and usability improvements from previous versions. The visual consistency across all three pages creates a better user experience and makes the wizard more intuitive to use.
