# Pull Request Summary: GUI Responsiveness & Error Handling Refactoring

## 🎯 Overview

This PR refactors the Nextcloud Restore & Backup Utility to address GUI responsiveness issues during heavy operations (decryption/extraction) and improves error handling throughout the application.

## 📋 Problem Statement Requirements

All requirements from the problem statement have been successfully implemented:

1. ✅ **Background Threading** - Decryption and extraction in background threads
2. ✅ **Robust Config Detection** - Already implemented using tarfile + recursive search
3. ✅ **Wizard Page Alignment** - Already properly centered using canvas approach
4. ✅ **Progress Indication** - Animated spinner with clear status messages
5. ✅ **Error Handling** - Comprehensive, user-friendly error messages

## 🔧 Key Code Changes

### 1. Background Threading in perform_extraction_and_detection()

**Impact:** GUI never freezes during detection

```python
# Added animated spinner that updates every 100ms
spinner_chars = ["⠋", "⠙", "⠹", "⠸", "⠼", "⠴", "⠦", "⠧", "⠇", "⠏"]

# Detection runs in background thread
detection_thread = threading.Thread(target=do_detection, daemon=True)
detection_thread.start()

# GUI remains responsive with animated feedback
while detection_thread.is_alive():
    # Update spinner animation
    self.update_idletasks()
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Messages

All error messages now user-friendly and actionable:

| Scenario | Old Message | New Message |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Wrong Password | `gpg: decryption failed: Bad session key` | `Decryption failed: Incorrect password provided` |
| Corrupted Archive | `ReadError: file could not be opened` | `The backup archive appears to be corrupted or invalid` |
| Disk Full | `[Errno 28] No space left on device` | `Not enough disk space to extract the backup` |
| Missing GPG | `FileNotFoundError: 'gpg'` | `GPG is not installed on your system` |

### 3. Improved fast_extract_tar_gz()

Added specific error handling:
- `tarfile.ReadError` → Corrupted archive message
- `OSError errno 28` → Disk space message
- `OSError errno 13` → Permission denied message
