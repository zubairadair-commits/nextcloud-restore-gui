# Progress Bar Visual Comparison

## Before Update

```
Progress during restore:
0%                    50%                   100%
|---------------------|---------------------|
[====] Extraction 20%
     [==] Setup 30%
          [======] Copying 60%
                         [===] DB 75%
                             [========] Final 100%
```

**Problem:** 
- Copying only used 30% of the bar (30-60%)
- Final steps jumped rapidly from 75% to 100%
- Progress appeared to "hang" during copying
- Then suddenly jumped at the end

## After Update

```
Progress during restore:
0%                    50%                   100%
|---------------------|---------------------|
[====] Extraction 20%
    [=====================================] Copying 80%
                                          [==] DB 90%
                                            [==] Final 100%
```

**Improvement:**
- Copying now uses 60% of the bar (20-80%) ✨
- Steady, predictable progress
- No sudden jumps at the end
- Visual representation matches actual time spent

## Real-World Example

### Scenario: Restoring a 5GB Nextcloud backup

**Time Distribution:**
- Extraction: 2 minutes (10%)
- Container setup: 30 seconds (2%)
- Copying data: 15 minutes (75%) ← Longest step
- Database restore: 1 minute (5%)
- Finalization: 1.5 minutes (8%)
- **Total: ~20 minutes**

### Before (Old Progress Bar)
```
[00:00-02:00] 0% → 20%    Extracting... (smooth)
[02:00-02:30] 20% → 30%   Setting up... (quick)
[02:30-17:30] 30% → 60%   Copying... (APPEARS SLOW - only 30% of bar for 75% of time!)
[17:30-18:30] 60% → 75%   Database... (quick jump)
[18:30-20:00] 75% → 100%  Finalizing... (RAPID JUMPS - 25% of bar in 7.5% of time!)
```

User sees progress "stuck" at 30-60% for most of the restore, then it suddenly jumps from 75% to 100%.

### After (New Progress Bar)
```
[00:00-02:00] 0% → 20%    Extracting... (smooth)
[02:00-02:30] 20% → 20%   Setting up... (instant)
[02:30-17:30] 20% → 80%   Copying... (STEADY - 60% of bar for 75% of time!)
[17:30-18:30] 80% → 90%   Database... (proportional)
[18:30-20:00] 90% → 100%  Finalizing... (steady)
```

User sees smooth, predictable progress throughout. The bar moves steadily during copying (the longest step) and doesn't jump at the end.

## Benefits Summary

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Copying allocation** | 30% of bar | 60% of bar ✨ |
| **Progress during copying** | Slow, appears stuck | Smooth, steady |
| **End-of-restore jumps** | Yes (75→100%) | No (90→100%) |
| **User perception** | "Hangs" then "jumps" | Predictable throughout |
| **Time estimates** | Inaccurate | Accurate |
| **Visual accuracy** | Misleading | Matches reality |

## Conclusion

The updated progress bar provides:
- ✅ Accurate visual representation of restore process
- ✅ Smooth, predictable progress during longest operation
- ✅ No surprising jumps at the end
- ✅ Better user experience and transparency
- ✅ More accurate time estimates

**The copying data step now occupies 60% of the progress bar (up from 30%), accurately reflecting that it typically takes 60-80% of the total restore time.**
