# UI Changes: Admin Credentials Removed from Restore Workflow

## Summary
This document describes the UI changes made to remove the admin username and password entry fields from the restore workflow, as these credentials should only be entered when creating a new Nextcloud instance, not when restoring from a backup.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed "Step 4: Nextcloud Admin Credentials" Section
**Location:** `create_wizard_page2()` method (lines 5907-5926)

**Before:**
- The restore wizard had a "Step 4: Nextcloud Admin Credentials" section
- Users were prompted to enter:
  - Admin Username (text field)
  - Admin Password (password field)
- This was confusing because during restore, the admin credentials come from the backup, not from user input

**After:**
- This entire section has been removed from the restore workflow
- The wizard now flows directly from database credentials to container configuration
- No admin credential fields are shown during restore

### 2. Updated Restore Completion Message
**Location:** `show_restore_completion_dialog()` method (lines 9446-9459)

**Before:**
- Only displayed admin username if extraction succeeded
- No message if admin username extraction failed

**After:**
- Always displays a message instructing the user to log in with their previous credentials
- If admin username extraction succeeds: "Log in with your previous admin credentials. Your admin username is: [username]"
- If admin username extraction fails: "Log in with your previous admin credentials."
- This ensures users always know they need to use their original credentials from the backup

## Technical Changes

### Code Modifications
1. **Removed UI Elements** (`create_wizard_page2`)
   - Deleted Step 4 section header and description
   - Removed admin username Entry widget
   - Removed admin password Entry widget

2. **Removed Data Collection** (`save_wizard_page_data`)
   - Removed code that saves `admin_user_entry` value
   - Removed code that saves `admin_password_entry` value

3. **Removed Validation** (`validate_and_start_restore`)
   - Removed retrieval of `admin_user` and `admin_password` from wizard_data
   - Removed validation checks for admin username and password
   - Removed storage of `restore_admin_user` and `restore_admin_password`

4. **Updated Container Creation** (`restore_backup_archive`)
   - Removed code that set `NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER` and `NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables
   - Added comment explaining that admin credentials are restored from backup database
   - Container is now created without admin credential environment variables

5. **Enhanced Completion Message** (`show_restore_completion_dialog`)
   - Now always displays a message about using previous credentials
   - Shows extracted admin username if available
   - Shows generic message if username extraction failed
   - Ensures users are never left without guidance on how to log in

## Behavior Changes

### During Restore Process
- **Before:** Container was created with admin credentials from user input
- **After:** Container is created without admin credentials (they come from restored database)

### After Restore Completion
- **Before:** User might not see admin username if extraction failed
- **After:** User always sees a message to log in with previous credentials

## New Instance Workflow (Unchanged)
The "Start New Nextcloud Instance" workflow still includes admin credential entry fields as expected:
- Location: `show_port_entry()` method (lines 10393-10416)
- Users enter admin username and password when creating a new instance
- These credentials are used to initialize the new Nextcloud installation

## Benefits
1. **Less Confusing:** Users are no longer asked for credentials that shouldn't be set during restore
2. **More Accurate:** Restore process correctly uses credentials from the backup database
3. **Better UX:** Clear messaging about using previous credentials after restore
4. **Prevents Errors:** Eliminates potential conflicts between user-entered credentials and backup credentials

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test restore workflow to ensure it proceeds without admin credential fields
2. Verify that restored Nextcloud instance can be accessed with original admin credentials
3. Confirm completion message always displays, with or without extracted username
4. Verify new instance workflow still has admin credential fields (should be unchanged)
