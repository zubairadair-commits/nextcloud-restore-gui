# Implementation Complete: Extraction and Detection Before Page 2

## Problem Statement (Original Request)

Update the Nextcloud Restore & Backup Utility wizard to perform backup archive extraction and database type detection immediately after the user selects a backup archive (Page 1 of the wizard). Before rendering Page 2 (Database Configuration), ensure the app has parsed config/config.php for dbtype.

**Requirements:**
- If dbtype is 'sqlite' or 'sqlite3', hide or disable the database credential fields (name, user, password) and display a clear message that credentials are not required for SQLite.
- If dbtype is 'mysql' or 'pgsql', show the credential input fields as normal.
- Ensure this check applies both to auto-detected and manually selected database types.
- Refactor the wizard flow so extraction and detection are done before Page 2, not after.
- Update UI and error handling so SQLite users never see unnecessary credential fields.

## Root Cause Analysis

The original implementation had a timing issue:

1. **Unencrypted backups (.tar.gz)**: Detection worked correctly via `browse_backup()` when file was selected
2. **Encrypted backups (.tar.gz.gpg)**: Detection was **skipped** because the password wasn't available yet - detection only happened during the restore process (after Page 3)
3. **Result**: SQLite users with encrypted backups still saw unnecessary database credential fields on Page 2

## Solution Overview

Implemented a **pre-navigation detection phase** that runs when user clicks "Next" from Page 1 to Page 2:

```
Page 1 (Backup + Password) 
    → Click "Next" 
    → ⚙️ EXTRACT & DETECT (NEW)
    → Page 2 (Database Config with conditional UI)
```

## Key Changes

### 1. Modified `wizard_navigate()` - Line 795
- Intercepts navigation from Page 1 to Page 2
- Calls `perform_extraction_and_detection()` before showing Page 2
- Resets detection when navigating back (allows password correction)

### 2. New `perform_extraction_and_detection()` - Line 837
- Validates backup file and password
- Shows progress message during detection
- Handles detection failures gracefully
- Prevents duplicate detection

### 3. Enhanced `early_detect_database_type_from_backup()` - Line 1435
- Added optional `password` parameter
- Decrypts encrypted backups to temporary file
- Extracts config.php and parses dbtype
- Cleans up temporary files

## Testing Results

✅ **All 6 comprehensive wizard flow tests passed:**
- SQLite unencrypted - Credentials hidden correctly
- SQLite encrypted - Credentials hidden correctly  
- PostgreSQL unencrypted - Credentials shown correctly
- PostgreSQL encrypted - Credentials shown correctly
- MySQL unencrypted - Credentials shown correctly
- MySQL encrypted - Credentials shown correctly

## Benefits

✅ SQLite users never see unnecessary database credential fields
✅ Detection happens before Page 2 for ALL backup types
✅ Better UX with progress feedback
✅ Validation prevents navigation with invalid data
✅ Graceful error handling
✅ Edge cases handled (back navigation, backup changes)
✅ No performance impact - single config.php extraction
✅ Fully backward compatible
