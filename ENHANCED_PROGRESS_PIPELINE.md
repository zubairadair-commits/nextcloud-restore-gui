# Enhanced Progress Bar - Full Restore Pipeline

## Overview

The progress bar now covers the **entire restore pipeline**, providing smooth, continuous feedback from 0% to 100% across all major restoration steps. Users see real-time updates with specific details about file sizes, counts, and current operations.

## Progress Range Allocation

The restore process is divided into clear percentage ranges:

| Phase | Range | Duration | Description |
|-------|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Decryption** | 0-10% | Variable | Decrypt GPG-encrypted backup with animated progress |
| **Extraction** | 10-20% | Variable | Extract tar.gz archive with live file/byte count |
| **Detection** | 20-22% | ~2-5s | Detect database type from config.php |
| **Docker Setup** | 22-30% | ~30-60s | Create and configure containers |
| **File Copying** | 30-60% | Variable | Copy folders with size tracking and per-folder progress |
| **Database Restore** | 60-75% | Variable | Import database with size display and animated progress |
| **Config Update** | 76-80% | ~5-10s | Update config.php with credentials |
| **Validation** | 81-85% | ~5-10s | Validate config.php and data folder |
| **Permissions** | 86-90% | ~10-20s | Set file ownership (www-data) |
| **Container Restart** | 91-95% | ~5-10s | Restart container to apply changes |
| **Completion** | 95-100% | Instant | Final success message |

## Key Features

### 1. Extraction Phase (0-20%)

**Previous Behavior:**
- Progress went from 0% to 100% during extraction only
- No progress shown for other restore steps

**New Behavior:**
- Extraction maps to 0-20% of overall progress
- Byte-based progress for compressed archives
- File-count progress when total files are known
- Smooth animation as files are extracted

```python
# Progress calculation (mapped to 0-20%)
progress_val = int((file_percent / 100) * 20)
status_msg = f"Extracting: {files_extracted}/{total_files} files"
```

### 2. File Copying Phase (30-60%)

**New Feature: Granular Folder Progress**

- Calculates total size of folders before copying
- Shows progress for each folder individually
- Displays file sizes (MB/GB) for user awareness
- Uses threading for non-blocking operations
- Animates progress during copy operations

```python
folders = ["config", "data", "apps", "custom_apps"]
# Each folder gets a proportional share of the 30-60% range
folder_start_progress = 30 + int((idx / len(folders)) * 30)
folder_end_progress = 30 + int(((idx + 1) / len(folders)) * 30)
```

**User sees:**
```
[████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░] 35% | Copying data (2.3 GB)...
```

### 3. Database Restore Phase (60-75%)

**New Feature: Database Import Progress**

- Shows SQL file size before import
- Uses threading for non-blocking database restore
- Animates progress during import (62-72%)
- Validates database after import (73-75%)
- Supports all database types: SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL

**SQLite:**
```python
# Shows database file size and validates existence
db_size_str = self._format_bytes(db_size)
self.set_restore_progress(65, f"Verifying SQLite database: {db_file} ({db_size_str})")
```

**MySQL/PostgreSQL:**
```python
# Shows SQL file size and animates during import
sql_size_str = self._format_bytes(sql_size)
self.set_restore_progress(62, f"Restoring MySQL database ({sql_size_str})...")
# Progress increments 62% → 72% during import
```

### 4. Config Update & Validation (76-85%)

**New Feature: Progress During Config Operations**

- Updates progress during config.php modification (76-80%)
- Shows progress during file validation (81-85%)
- Provides feedback at each validation step

### 5. Permissions & Restart (86-95%)

**New Feature: Progress During Final Steps**

- Shows progress while setting permissions (86-90%)
- Shows progress during container restart (91-95%)
- Ensures users see activity until completion

### 6. Thread-Safe UI Updates

All progress updates use `safe_widget_update()` for thread safety:

```python
safe_widget_update(
    self.process_label,
    lambda: self.process_label.config(text=f"Copying {folder} folder..."),
    "process label update in restore thread"
)
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents UI freezing during long operations
- Avoids TclError exceptions
- Ensures smooth, responsive interface
- Gracefully handles window closure

## Testing

### Automated Validation

Run the validation test to verify implementation:

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/nextcloud-restore-gui/nextcloud-restore-gui
python3 tests/test_enhanced_progress_tracking.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ All validation checks passed! (5/5)
  ✓ Progress Ranges - 54 progress update calls found
  ✓ Extraction Mapping - Correctly maps to 0-20%
  ✓ File Copying Progress - Folder size tracking implemented
  ✓ Database Progress - All DB types have progress tracking
  ✓ Thread-Safe Updates - 60 safe_widget_update calls
```

### Visual Demo

Run the progress simulation demo:

```bash
python3 tests/demo_enhanced_progress_pipeline.py
```

This shows a simulated restore with animated progress bars for each phase.

### Manual UI Testing

To test with the actual GUI:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Docker installed and running
   - A Nextcloud backup file (.tar.gz or .tar.gz.gpg)
   - Backup contains config, data, apps folders

2. **Steps:**
   ```bash
   python3 src/nextcloud_restore_and_backup-v9.py
   ```

3. **What to observe:**
   - Progress bar starts at 0% during decryption/extraction
   - Progress increases smoothly through all phases
   - Status messages show current operation and file sizes
   - Progress reaches 100% at completion
   - No freezing or UI lag during operations

4. **Expected behavior:**
   - Extraction: 0% → 20% with file count updates
   - File copying: 30% → 60% with folder sizes shown
   - Database: 60% → 75% with SQL size and animated progress
   - Config/validation: 76% → 85% with step-by-step feedback
   - Permissions/restart: 86% → 95% with status updates
   - Completion: 95% → 100% with success message

1. **Continuous Feedback**: Never wondering if the restore is still working
2. **Time Awareness**: Progress bar helps estimate remaining time
3. **Detailed Status**: See exactly what's happening at each step
4. **File Size Context**: Understand why some steps take longer
5. **Smooth Experience**: No UI freezing or lag

### For Developers

1. **Maintainable**: Clear progress ranges for each phase
2. **Extensible**: Easy to add new phases or adjust ranges
3. **Testable**: Validation tests ensure correctness
4. **Thread-Safe**: Proper synchronization prevents race conditions
5. **Well-Documented**: Comments explain each progress range

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Network Progress**: Track progress during remote backup/restore
2. **Parallel Operations**: Multiple progress bars for concurrent tasks
3. **Retry Logic**: Progress preservation during retry operations
4. **Speed Metrics**: Show MB/s transfer rates during copying
5. **Detailed Logs**: Link progress to detailed operation logs

## Troubleshooting

### Progress Stuck at Certain Percentage

**Symptoms:** Progress bar stops updating for extended period

**Common causes:**
- Large data folder copying (30-60% range)
- Large database import (60-75% range)
- Slow disk I/O or network

**Resolution:**
- Check process_label for current operation
- Check system resources (disk space, CPU, memory)
- Allow more time for large files/databases

### Progress Jumps or Skips

**Symptoms:** Progress jumps from one value to another rapidly

**Possible causes:**
- Small backup with few files
- Fast SSD making operations quick
- Cached Docker images

**Resolution:**
- This is normal for small backups
- Progress ranges are proportional to typical restore times

### UI Freezes

**Symptoms:** Window becomes unresponsive

**Causes:**
- Thread safety issues (should not occur with current implementation)
- System resource exhaustion

**Resolution:**
- Check available memory and disk space
- Restart application
- Report issue with logs from Documents/NextcloudLogs/

## Summary

The enhanced progress bar provides a **professional, smooth restore experience** with:

✅ **Continuous 0-100% progress** across entire restore pipeline  
✅ **Real-time feedback** with file sizes and operation details  
✅ **Thread-safe updates** preventing UI freezing  
✅ **Accurate progress** for all major steps  
✅ **User confidence** through visible, continuous activity  

The implementation transforms the restore process from a black-box operation into a transparent, trackable workflow that keeps users informed at every step.
