## 💻 Code Changes

### 1. Modified `run_test_backup()` Function

**Location:** `nextcloud_restore_and_backup-v9.py`, line 2152

**Changes Made:**
- Changed from backing up a test.txt file to backing up the actual `schedule_config.json`
- Uses `get_schedule_config_path()` to locate the config file
- Creates a tar.gz archive containing only the config file
- Immediately deletes the backup after successful creation
- Updated logging and success messages to reflect config-only backup

**Key Code:**
```python
def run_test_backup(backup_dir, encrypt, password=""):
    """
    Run a test backup to verify the configuration works.
    Only backs up the schedule config file, then immediately deletes it.
    Returns (success, message) tuple.
    """
    logger.info("TEST RUN: Starting test backup of config file")
    
    try:
        # Get the schedule config file path
        config_path = get_schedule_config_path()
        
        # Check if config file exists
        if not os.path.exists(config_path):
            logger.error("TEST RUN: Schedule config file not found")
            return False, "Test backup failed: Schedule configuration file not found."
        
        # Create a test backup of the config file
        test_backup_name = f"test_config_backup_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}.tar.gz"
        test_backup_path = os.path.join(backup_dir, test_backup_name)
        
        # Create tar.gz archive with just the config file
        with tarfile.open(test_backup_path, 'w:gz') as tar:
            tar.add(config_path, arcname='schedule_config.json')
        
        # Verify the backup was created
        if os.path.exists(test_backup_path):
            file_size = os.path.getsize(test_backup_path)
            logger.info(f"TEST RUN: Config backup created successfully: {test_backup_path} ({file_size} bytes)")
            
            # Immediately delete the test backup
            try:
                os.remove(test_backup_path)
                logger.info("TEST RUN: Config backup deleted after successful test")
            except Exception as cleanup_error:
                logger.warning(f"TEST RUN: Failed to delete test backup: {cleanup_error}")
            
            return True, f"✓ Test backup successful!\n\nConfig file backed up: schedule_config.json\nTest backup size: {file_size} bytes\nLocation verified: {backup_dir}\nBackup immediately deleted (as expected)\n\nYour scheduled backup configuration is working correctly."
```

### 2. Changed Default Theme to Dark Mode

**Location:** `nextcloud_restore_and_backup-v9.py`, line 2745

**Changes Made:**
- Changed `self.current_theme = 'light'` to `self.current_theme = 'dark'`
- App now starts in dark mode by default
- Theme toggle functionality preserved
- Users can still switch to light mode using the toggle button

**Key Code:**
```python
self.current_theme = 'dark'
self.theme_colors = THEMES[self.current_theme]
```

## 🧪 Testing

### New Tests Created

1. **test_config_backup_and_dark_mode.py**
   - Verifies Test Run backs up only config file
   - Confirms backup is immediately deleted
   - Validates dark mode is default
   - Ensures theme toggle still works

2. **test_integration_config_backup.py**
   - Integration test simulating actual backup behavior
   - Validates backup creation and deletion
   - Tests prerequisites (config exists, directory writable)
   - Confirms no disk space consumed after test

### Test Results

```
✅ test_config_backup_and_dark_mode.py - 4/4 tests passed
✅ test_integration_config_backup.py - 2/2 tests passed
✅ test_test_run_button.py - 7/7 tests passed (no regressions)
✅ test_scheduled_backup_validation.py - All tests passed
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### Test Run Button Refinement

**Before:**
- Created a temporary test.txt file
- Backed up the test file in a tar.gz archive
- Deleted the backup after creation
- Did not test actual config backup

**After:**
- Backs up the actual `schedule_config.json` file
- Validates the real backup configuration
- Creates a realistic backup archive
- Immediately deletes backup (no disk space consumed)
- Provides confidence that scheduled backups will work

**Key Improvements:**
1. ✓ **More realistic testing** - Uses actual config file instead of dummy data
2. ✓ **Better validation** - Verifies the actual backup configuration works
3. ✓ **No disk waste** - Backup is immediately deleted after verification
4. ✓ **Faster execution** - Config file is much smaller than full backup
5. ✓ **Clear feedback** - Messages indicate config-only backup

### Dark Mode Default

**Before:**
- App started in light mode
- Users had to manually switch to dark mode
- Bright theme on startup

**After:**
- App starts in dark mode by default
- Better for users who prefer dark themes
- Reduced eye strain in low-light conditions
- Users can still toggle to light mode
- Preference is maintained during session

**Key Benefits:**
1. ✓ **Modern default** - Dark mode is increasingly preferred
2. ✓ **Eye comfort** - Reduces strain in low-light environments
3. ✓ **User choice preserved** - Toggle still available
4. ✓ **Consistency** - Matches modern application trends
