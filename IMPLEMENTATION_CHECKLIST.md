# Implementation Checklist - Enhanced Extraction Progress UI

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

### Core Requirements - All Met ✅

#### 1. Real-Time Progress Updates
- [x] Changed `batch_size` from 50 to 1 for updates on every file
- [x] Progress bar updates continuously during extraction
- [x] Verified with 150-file test archive
- [x] Works smoothly with large archives (10,000+ files tested)

#### 2. Immediate User Feedback
- [x] Added `prepare_callback` parameter to `fast_extract_tar_gz()`
- [x] Implemented "Preparing extraction..." message
- [x] Message shows before blocking `tarfile.open()` operation
- [x] Eliminates perceived delay for user

#### 3. Thread-Safe UI Updates
- [x] Implemented proper Tkinter `after()` method
- [x] Created nested `update_ui()` function for encapsulation
- [x] Replaced direct widget updates with scheduled updates
- [x] Prevents race conditions and UI corruption

#### 4. Remove Artificial Throttling
- [x] Removed batch-based throttling
- [x] No `time.sleep()` in callback
- [x] Progress updates as fast as files are extracted
- [x] Verified no artificial delays

#### 5. Live File Information Display
- [x] Current file name displayed and updated
- [x] File count shown (e.g., "150/1000")
- [x] Elapsed time calculated and displayed
- [x] Estimated time remaining shown
- [x] Extraction rate displayed
